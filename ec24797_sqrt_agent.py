def sqrt_agent_abs_error(x):
    """
    Estimates the square root of a number using Newton's method with an absolute error objective function.
    
    Parameters:
    - x (float or int): The number to find the square root of (it should be positive)
    
    Returns:
    - float: The estimated square root of x.
    
    Example usage:
    >>> x = 25
    >>> estimated_sqrt = sqrt_agent_abs_error(x)
    >>> print(f"Estimated square root of {x} is {estimated_sqrt:.6f}")
    
    Notes:
    The function initializes with a random guess and iteratively adjusts this guess based on the gradient of the 
    absolute error objective function. It terminates if the square root is sufficiently close to the target value or if the maximum 
    number of epochs is reached.

    # STEP 1: initialize y to be a random guess between 0 and x
    # HINT: use random.uniform

    # STEP 2: Start the iterative process to refine the guess 'y'
    # WHY DO WE NEED IT? The loop continues until the square of 'y' is sufficiently close to 'x'.
    # HINT: use a while loop

    # STEP 3: Calculate the current error as the difference between y squared and x
    # WHY DO WE NEED IT? Knowing the error helps us understand how far 'y' is from being a correct square root

    # STEP 4: Check the convergence criterion
    # WHY DO WE NEED IT? We need a stopping condition that is sufficiently strict to ensure accuracy but
    # also prevents unnecessary computations if 'y' is close enough to the actual square root.
    # HINT: The loop exits when the absolute error is less than a very small threshold (1e-6, for example).

    # STEP 5: Compute the gradient of the objective function
    # WHY DO WE NEED IT? The gradient indicates the direction and rate of the fastest increase in the error,

    # STEP 6: Update the estimate 'y' using the calculated gradient and the magnitude of the error
    # WHY DO WE NEED IT? This step adjusts 'y' towards the actual square root
