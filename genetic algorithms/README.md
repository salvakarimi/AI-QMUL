The optimization of feedforward neural network architectures for a challenging classification task.
We have a dataset of Farsi vowel audio (6 different vowel types in total) in
the file called genetic.py. 
The task is evolving neural network architectures that can accurately classify these vowels. Each architectureâ€™s effectiveness will be assessed based on its accuracy in predicting the correct class for each data point.
